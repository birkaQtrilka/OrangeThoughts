                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>
                    A cards-based roguelike which parodies the 1980's USA cult culture. 
                    You play the game as the cult leader and you use your cult members as sacrifices to the gods to
                    defeat the enemies who are depicted as traditional demonic entities. 
                </p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    In this game jam, we had a team of 6. I was responsible for the card dragging mechanic, the card management system, 
                    the procedural map generation and the sound manager. The sound manager spawns SoundSource components via an object pooling 
                    system. I always try to find ways to structure my code with design patterns, but I understand that sometimes it's better 
                    to not force it.
                    
                </p>
                <h3>Soft Skills development</h3>
                <p>
                    We had a well structured ideation process after which everyone was happy with the idea. I also had the 
                    pleasure to learn how to work with an experienced 
                    engineer. We planned the structure of the game and our code. For example, we decided to use enums as keys for our sounds in the 
                    dictionary because it will be easier for designers (the dropdown), it's really robust, and because the project is small so we need to
                    save time. We had some conflicts where I wasn't sure if we would be able to implement all the mechanics in time, but my engineering teammate 
                    assured me that we can. I was convinced by her arguments and because she was much more experienced than me and that was it with the conflict.
