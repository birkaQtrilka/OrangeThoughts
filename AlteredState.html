                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; A cards-based roguelike that parodies the 1980s USA cult culture. 
                    You play the game as the cult leader and you use your cult members 
                    as sacrifices to the gods to defeat the enemies who are depicted as traditional demonic entities.

                </p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; In this 2 day game jam, we had a team of 6. I was responsible for the card dragging mechanic, the card management system, 
                    the procedural map generation, and the sound manager. For the procedural map generation I did a white board graph discussing with
                    my partner how the algorithm is going to work. Same with sound manager, where we agreed to make it hard coded, so our designer
                    can just call the function without worrying about spelling mistakes or other variables. The sound manager spawns SoundSource components via an object 
                    pooling system. I always try to find ways to structure my code with design patterns, but I understand that sometimes
                     it's better to not force it. Also, all my work was done in a sepparate Unity scene and in my own folder, so I can do tests
                     without worying about git merge conflicts.
                    
                </p>
                <h3>Soft Skills development</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; We had a well-structured ideation process after which everyone was happy with the idea. I also had the pleasure of learning 
                    how to work with an experienced engineer. We planned the structure of the game and our code. For example, we decided to use 
                    enums as keys for our sounds in the dictionary (we used a serialized dictionary package) because it will be easier for designers (the dropdown), it's robust, and 
                    because the project is small. We had some conflicts where I wasn't sure if we would be able to implement 
                    all the mechanics in time, but my engineering teammate assured me that we could. I was convinced by her argument of "these are just
                    juice elements, if we don't make it all, it's fine because we will have the core done", so we moved on.
