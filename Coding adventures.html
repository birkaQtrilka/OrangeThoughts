                    &emsp; A window that's filled procedurally generated tiles that must connect. 
                    It is based on the wave function collapse algorithm: <br>&emsp;&emsp; Each tile has a superstate <br>&emsp;&emsp; A random state is picked from the tile with the least superstates<br>&emsp;&emsp; The rest of the cells then update their superstates based on conditions (such as every tiles must connect) <br>&emsp;&emsp; Repeat.
                    <br>&emsp; The challenge I encountered was to include rotated versions of tiles in the superstates. I just added the rotated tiles as separate objects (as if they are different tiles) in the list of superstates.

                    &emsp; A space partitioning algorithm that I will later use for my flocking simulation.
                    It divides the space into quadrants and stores the objects that have a bounding box into the quadrants that fully contain them
                    <br>&emsp; The challenge I encountered was to decide what will be the condition of subdividing: the number of entities in the cell 
                    or the fact that the enitity is wholy contained in the cell.

                    &emsp; A physics engine that handles continuous collisions between circles, angled lines and AABBs. It doesn't support rotation yet.
                    My aim was to improve my math and physics skills, especially in vectors as it's so prevalent in game development.
                    &emsp; The main challenge was to solve the weird edge cases.. literally. The circles would bounce weirdly at the corners of 
                    rectangles and at the ends of segments. To solve this, I added "caps". These are circles placed at the ends of segments that have the 
                    radius set to zero.

                    &emsp; An algorithm that simulates the formation of groups of moving bodies. 
                    <br>&emsp; The challenge was to optimize the algorithm because every boid would have to check (in the unoptimized case) 
                    every other boid in order for it to get the right data. This would mean an O(n^2) complexity. To solve this problem, I used 
                    the before learned quad tree data structure. However, I modified it to squeeze as many frames as I could. For example, 
                    the boids are counted as points, not bounding boxes.
