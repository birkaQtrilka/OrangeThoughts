                    &emsp; A continuation of Sebastian Lague's 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN39W020LqU&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cONs3T0By4puYy6GM22ko8">
                        procedural planet generation tutorial
                    </a>. In this project, I learned how to create meshes in code by making an ocean mesh that follows the contour of the planet's 
                    land. My solution was to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares">marching squares algorithm</a>.
                    You divide the mesh into squares and you give the corners a value 
                    of how close it is to the ocean level. Then, you get the correct configuration of the mesh in that cell from the lookup table that has
                    all the possible ways a cell can look like.
                    <br>&emsp;The main challenge was understanding how the generation of meshes works, as well as finding the right solution. I randomly
                    stumbled upon the square marching algorithm and realized that I could use it for this project. Implementing the algorithm was hard, but I had
                    a lot of fun doing it.

                <p>
                    &emsp; Because the Unity Data Oriented Technology Stack was released, I decided to learn it by doing a project. I use the 
                    earlier learned <a href="Coding adventures.html#Boids">Boids Algorithm</a> as the problem to optimize. However, this time 
                    I use an easier space partitioning algorithm, so I can focus more on how DOTS works. The way it works is that a region in 
                    space has its hash code that is used as a key in a HashTable. The limitation is that boids interact only in the bounds of a 
                    particular cell and not in their respective perception radius.
                    <br>&emsp; The main challenge I encountered was to find the right documentation to learn from. Many tutorials use deprecated 
                    functions and even workflows.

                    My aim was to improve my math and physics skills, especially in vectors as it's so prevalent in game development.
                    <br>&emsp;The main challenge was to solve the weird edge cases.. literally. The circles would bounce weirdly at the corners of 
                    rectangles and at the ends of segments. To solve this, I added "caps". These are circles placed at the ends of segments that have the 
                    radius set to zero.

                    generated using a binary space partitioning algorithm, the rooms that "collide" will form doors that will be elongated as the rooms
                    randomly shrink. The pathfinding is implemented using the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/">A* algorithm</a>.
                    <br>&emsp;The main challenges were:

                    state and a walking state, so the legs don't look odd while idle.

                <p>
                    &emsp; Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behavior of birds,
                     and related group motion.
                    <br>&emsp; The challenge was to optimize the algorithm because every boid would have to check (in the unoptimized case) 
                    every other boid for it to get the right data. This would mean an O(n^2) complexity. To solve this problem, I used 
                    the quadtree data structure. I am aware that using 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_(computational_geometry)#:~:text=In%20computational%20geometry%2C%20the%20bin,histogram%20ordered%20into%20100%2C000%20bins.">
                        bins
                    </a> 
                    is 
                    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374977849_Comparing_bins_and_quadtree_optimizations_of_the_boids_simulation_to_the_naive_approach">better</a>
                    for this algorithm, however, I still chose quadtrees because it sounded more fun and I think I would use it more often in 
                    future projects. However, I will definitely play around with the former algorithm too.
