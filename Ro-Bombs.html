                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; A bomb diffuse arcade game where you have to beat minigames to not trigger the bomb wires. If you trigger 5 wires, the 
                    bomb will explode. Each minigame gets harder as the score increases. We also designed and built a custom controller for 
                    the game (as seen in the trailer). The buttons are inside holes and if you touch the walls, you will trigger a wire in the game.
                </p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; In this university project, we were a team of 6. I was responsible for making and juicing the 4 out of 8 minigames for the game. I 
                    made a difficulty system where each minigame has a custom way of getting harder. 
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Also, I planned the architecture of the project as well as made a designer-friendly interface by integrating the low-level 
                    engine provided by the university (GXPengine) with <span><a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/" target="_blank">Tiled</a></span>, which is an interface that returns the data as XML files.
                </p>
                <h3>Soft Skills Development</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; I was the scrum master and used <span><a href="https://hacknplan.com/">HacknPlan</a></span> (a planning tool) to give each team member tasks that we agreed on as a team. 
                    We had daily meetups and constantly adapted to the new problems. During the meetings I had to do some micromanaging and, 
                    as a result, I learned a lot about the processes of game design, sound design, asset creation, and management. 
                    <br> &emsp; Additionally, we had a 
                    conflict where a team member wasn't happy with the ideation process being too long. In trying to solve the conflict, we 
                    talked in a group and decided to set a deadline sooner but not minimize the importance of proper brainstorming.
                </p>
                <h3>What is the GXPengine?</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; It's a low-level engine that provides basic 2D physics, rendering, sound, an inheritance-based GameObject system and 
                    it parses the XML data from Tiled. There is no scene loading, data saving, or UI system which I made from scratch.
