                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; In this 3 week project, I applied my knowledge of procedural generation and made a city generator. I used the wave function
                    collapse algorithm, by dividing the city into tiles. The cool thing about this algorithm is that you can pre-place tiles. For example, 
                    before generating the world procedurally, we put a "start tile" and "end tile" in random spots on the grid.                   
                    <br>&emsp; The main challenge was to make a satisfying car controller. Also, it was my first coop project using the new input system.
                    I also felt that I didn't have much time to learn how to properly make player controls in coop, especially with UI.
