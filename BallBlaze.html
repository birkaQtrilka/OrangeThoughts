                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; A neon style, golf like game, where the player has to put objects in the environment so the ball reaches the hole in one strike.
                </p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; In this one week university project, we were a team of 6. Since it was after <span><a href="Ro-Bombs.html">Ro-Bombs</a></span>, I had already a working 
                    scene manager and designer friendly interface through <span><a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/" target="_blank">Tiled</a></span>. I also made a prefab system, so we don't have to hard code the 
                    data of objects, but rather just create it in Tiled and just clone it through code everytime we want an instance.
                    <br>
                    &emsp; However, the most important thing I did in the project was the continuous 2D physics system that implemented ball, rectangle and line
                    colliders. It was the result of a month of studying. I learned about what is and when to use the dot product, how to get the normal of a 
                    surface, some edge cases of collisions such as how to counteract the floating point error or sticky physics.
                </p>
                <h3>Soft Skills Development</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp;I was the scrum master and used <span><a href="https://hacknplan.com/">HacknPlan</a></span> (a planning tool) to give each team member tasks that we agreed on as a team. 
                    The mechanics were all planed out in advance. We did user research and analyzed different puzzle games. We also had a brainstorming session after which we had 
                    three prototypes. We tested each prototype and picked the best one based on feedback. After, our designers worked on the Game Design Document and the artists drew concept 
                    art. Meanwhile, I was working on the prefab system and the physics system. When the GDD was almost done, we started implementing everything. 
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Probably the biggest problem we had was that we did so well, that we didn't know if we wanted to add more content or improve the current ones.
                    At the end, we decided to add more content such as levels, backgrounds, sounds, and a website.
