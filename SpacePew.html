                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; I created a 3D space invaders-type game in a one week university project. In the game, you shoot enemies and as your score increases, 
                    the difficulty level also increases. To stay strong, players can pick up power-ups that stack up.
                </p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; In this project, I learned how to apply post-processing effects like bloom and color grading. I also implemented a difficulty 
                    system where enemy bullet stats and appearance change based on the player's score. Additionally, I created a bullet effect system 
                    that allows you to add as many modifiers to bullet stats as you want. It works by having a list of callback functions with the bullet 
                    object as a parameter. The items of list are then applied to the bullet after instantiation. 
                    &emsp; The main challenge was to make the turning mechanic with any ship speed and rotate+position the ship consistently on 
                    the same coordinates. Let's not forget that the turning also needs to feel natural, so I had to work on that too.
