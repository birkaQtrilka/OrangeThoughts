                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>
                    A space invaders type game in 3D. It was made in a week worth of solo work. You shoot enemies and the bigger the score, 
                    the harder the difficulty. To mentain strenght, the player will pick up power ups that can stack up. The movement is 
                    constraint as in you can only fly forward and are limited to dodge by going left and right. However, there are triggers 
                    that change your forward direction to make the gameplay more dynamic.
                </p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project I learned how to apply post processing effects such as bloom and color grading, I also took the initiative
                    to make a difficulty system in which enemy bullet stats (and their appearance) change depending on your score.
                    Furthermore, I made a bullet effect system where you can add as many modifiers to bullet stats as you want.
