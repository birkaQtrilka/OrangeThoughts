                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; You play in a constantly moving world, where music can create objects out of thin air. Use your newly discovered spells 
                    to find the secrets of this magic. Beware, your curiosity is a threat to the harmony created by “the blocks”, unfriendly 
                    entities that survive by keeping things on the beat.
                </p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; In this project, I learned how to synchronize sounds with game mechanics because the sound logic lives on a different thread in Unity. 
                    I also challenged myself by creating a different way of moving: lerping based on beat duration. Each enemy has a list of actions that 
                    they have to perform one at a time per beat, so you see these satisfying synchronous movements. I must be honest, making the player fall
                    naturally was a tough thing to design in that movement system.
                    <br>&emsp; Additionally, I used the tile rule system for the first time, which was fun.
                    <br>&emsp; Lastly, in this project, I used extensively unity events and realized their power. You can script not only with code but also with 
                    the inspector. Sounds so simple but it took some time for me to realize.

                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; Before all the programming, I wrote a 13 page Game Design Document which I had to follow. This helped me learn a lot on how to plan my 
                    code architecture.
